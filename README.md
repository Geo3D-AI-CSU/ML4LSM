# Stacking ensemble of machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping in Zhangjiajie City, Hunan Province, China

The current study aims to apply and compare the performance of six machine learning algorithms, including three basic classifiers: random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), as well as their hybrid classifiers, using the logistic regression (LR) method (RF + LR, GBDT + LR, and XGB + LR), to map the landslide susceptibility of Zhangjiajie City, Hunan Province, China.
